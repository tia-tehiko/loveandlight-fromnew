                    <li>When lighting your candle for the first time, alow the wax to melt all the way to the edge of the jar. There is no set time for this process, so burn for as long as the candle needs. This will prevent tunnelling and create an even burn for the duration of your candles life.</li>
                    <li>Please make sure you trim the wick before each use, this will minimise soot, prevent mushrooming and allow you to get the most out of your candle.</li>
                    <li>Always burn your candle within sight, keep away from drafts and vibrations. Do not burn your candle for more than 4 hours at a time.</li>
